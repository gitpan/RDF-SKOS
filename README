RDF::SKOS
=========

SKOS is one of the knowledge organisations systems, simpler, less
semantically committed that RDF and even less than Topic Maps.

This suite of packages provides the SKOS model itself (mostly
read-only, sorry), but also implementations holding concrete SKOSes
out there. Here nothing of the RDFishness is visible, but there is
also an implementation on top of RDF::Redland. Others can be added via
subclassing.
